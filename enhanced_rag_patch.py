        PCIe completion timeout handling is a critical mechanism for maintaining system stability.
        When a PCIe device issues a request that requires a completion, it starts a completion timeout timer.
        If no completion is received within the timeout period (typically 50ms), a completion timeout error is reported.
        During high traffic conditions, completion timeouts can occur more frequently due to increased latency
        and congestion in the PCIe fabric. The timeout mechanism helps prevent the system from hanging
        indefinitely waiting for responses that may never arrive.

Completion timeout handling in PCIe is a critical error recovery mechanism that activates when requests don't receive expected completions within specified timeframes.

### Key Points:

1. **Timeout Mechanism**: When a PCIe device sends a non-posted request (memory read, I/O, configuration), it starts a completion timeout timer (typically 50ms).

2. **High Traffic Impact**: During high traffic conditions, completion timeouts become more likely due to:
   - Increased latency in the PCIe fabric
   - Buffer congestion at switches and endpoints
   - Priority conflicts between different traffic types

3. **Error Reporting**: When timeout expires:
   - Completion Timeout (CTO) error is logged in AER registers
   - Error may be reported as correctable or uncorrectable depending on configuration
   - System may trigger error handling procedures

4. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Increase completion timeout values in high-latency environments
   - Implement traffic shaping and QoS mechanisms
   - Monitor AER error logs for patterns
   - Consider retry mechanisms for non-critical transactions

The completion timeout mechanism ensures system stability by preventing indefinite waits for responses that may never arrive, especially important in high-traffic scenarios where congestion can cause significant delays.
