## AI-Powered Insights

### Q: What is the root cause of these PCIe errors?
Based on waveform analysis, the primary root cause appears to be protocol violations. 
The system detected malformed TLP packets which indicates issues with:
1. TLP header formation logic
2. Field validation in the transmitter  
3. Possible firmware bugs in packet generation
4. Protocol compliance verification gaps

Recommendation: Review the TLP generation code and validate against PCIe specification.

### Q: What are the recommended fixes?
To fix the detected issues:

1. Immediate Actions:
   - Review TLP formation logic in transmitter
   - Validate TLP header field values
   - Check protocol compliance test coverage

2. Investigation:
   - Capture and analyze the malformed TLP details
   - Review recent firmware changes
   - Run protocol compliance tests

3. Long-term:
   - Implement stricter TLP validation
   - Add real-time protocol monitoring
   - Enhance error reporting mechanisms

### Q: Are these signal integrity issues?
The VCD analysis shows multiple recovery cycles indicating potential signal integrity issues:

Physical Layer Analysis:
- 12 recovery events detected (threshold: >5 = HIGH severity)
- Recovery cycles suggest link instability
- No direct CRC errors but pattern indicates SI problems

Recommendations:
- Check PCIe trace impedance and routing
- Measure eye diagrams at receiver
- Verify power delivery to PCIe components
- Check for EMI sources near PCIe lanes
