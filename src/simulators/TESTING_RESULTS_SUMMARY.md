## Detailed Analysis

### 🏆 VCD+AI Analysis (Best Performance)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Perfect accuracy**: 100% overall accuracy score
- ✅ **Comprehensive detection**: Finds all errors with exact timing
- ✅ **Root cause identification**: Correctly identifies protocol violations
- ✅ **Pattern recognition**: Detects excessive recovery cycles (12 vs threshold of 5)
- ✅ **Evidence-based**: Provides signal-level correlation and timing data
- ✅ **Fast performance**: Completes analysis in 0.01 seconds
- ✅ **Automated recommendations**: Generates actionable debugging steps

**Key Findings:**
- Detected 2 malformed TLP errors at exact times (2920000ns, 2925000ns)
- Identified 12 recovery cycles indicating signal integrity issues
- Correctly classified as protocol violation with high confidence
- Provided specific recommendations for TLP formation logic review

### ⚠️ AI-Only Analysis (Limited Performance)

**Limitations:**
- ❌ **Incomplete recovery detection**: Only sees 1 of 12 recovery cycles (8.3% accuracy)
- ❌ **No root cause identification**: Cannot determine actual causes (0% accuracy)
- ❌ **No timing analysis**: Cannot correlate events or measure latencies
- ❌ **Limited error context**: Misses signal-level correlations
- ❌ **Overestimation**: Reports 3 errors when only 2 exist

**Typical AI-Only Responses:**
- "Based on logs: Malformed TLP errors detected. Limited visibility..."
- "At least 1 recovery cycle observed. Actual count unknown..."
- "Cannot analyze timing without waveform data..."

### 🔧 Manual Analysis (Moderate Performance)

**Mixed Results:**
- ✅ **Accurate error detection**: Finds correct number of errors
- ✅ **Precise recovery counting**: Identifies all 12 recovery cycles
- ✅ **Timing capability**: Can measure signal timing manually
- ❌ **No root cause identification**: Requires expert interpretation
- ❌ **No automated recommendations**: Provides no actionable guidance
- ❌ **Time-intensive**: Takes 100x longer than automated methods

## Key Insights

### 1. **Accuracy Advantage**
VCD+AI provides **1.55x better accuracy** than AI-only methods by incorporating signal-level data.

### 2. **Completeness Gap**
AI-only methods miss **91.7% of recovery cycles** due to log-based limitations.

### 3. **Root Cause Analysis**
Only VCD+AI successfully identifies root causes automatically (100% vs 0% for other methods).

### 4. **Speed vs Accuracy**
VCD+AI achieves both high speed (0.01s) and perfect accuracy, while manual analysis is slow (1.0s) with gaps.

### 5. **Evidence Quality**
VCD+AI provides signal-level evidence and timing correlation that other methods cannot match.

## Real-World Example Analysis

### Error Detected: Malformed TLP at 2.92ms

**VCD+AI Analysis:**
```
Error Context:
- Type: MALFORMED_TLP
- Time: 2920000ns (exact)
- LTSSM State: L0
- Signal States: error_valid=1, error_type=4
- Recovery Attempts: 3 prior cycles
- Correlation: Follows invalid TLP type=7 transaction

Root Cause: Protocol violation in TLP formation
Recommendation: Review TLP generation logic, validate header fields
Evidence: Signal trace shows error_valid assertion 5ns after TLP_valid
```

**AI-Only Analysis:**
```
Based on logs: Malformed TLP errors detected. 
Limited visibility into full error picture.
Cannot determine exact timing or signal correlation.
```

**Manual Analysis:**
```
Visual inspection shows error at ~2.92ms.
TLP appears malformed but root cause unclear.
Would require expert analysis to determine fix.
```
