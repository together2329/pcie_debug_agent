## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Enhanced Features Don't Work

1. **Check System Status**
   ```bash
   🔧 > /rag --status
   ```
   Should show 20+ active components

2. **Rebuild Vector Database**
   ```bash
   🔧 > /vectordb build --force
   ```

3. **Run System Health Check**
   ```bash
   🔧 > /doctor
   ```

4. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/pcie_debug.log
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Low confidence scores
**Solution**: Ensure enhanced PDF parsing is active, check `/rag --status`

**Issue**: No compliance detection
**Solution**: Use queries with known violations like "completion during FLR"

**Issue**: Slow responses
**Solution**: Check system resources, try `/rag_mode keyword` for speed
